# Algorithms

We can use this repository to discuss how to do the programming assignments. I would suggest that we try to split the task. Then each one of us can upload their part into a new branch and we can comment on the changes before we add it to the master branch. Also if there are any issues or somebody needs help we can use the issues tab.
